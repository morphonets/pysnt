## Installation Requirements


The stack of dependencies used by PySNT is rather complex and includes Python 3.8+, Java 21+, [SNTv5 pre-release](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT/releases), [imglyb](https://github.com/imglib/imglyb), [jgo](https://github.com/scijava/jgo), [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy), [pyimagej][pyimagejdocs], [scyjava](https://github.com/scijava/scyjava), among others. Because of this complexity we recommend using a package manager. We endorse Mamba
since Conda can be painfully slow with complex environments. If you do not have Mamba installed you can do
so by [Installing Miniforge3](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#miniforge3).

```{important}
In the future, PySNT will automatically download SNT if it is not found. For now, you'll need to download it manually
(see installation instructions below).
```

Here we only summarize the _easiest_ way to install pysnt. For other (advanced) install options (via pip, condacolab,
dynamic install, etc.) you should be able to adapt the advanced install documentation of [pyimagej][pyimagejdocs]. If
you want to debug or improve PySNT have a look at
[Install Instructions for Developers](https://github.com/morphonets/pysnt?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started-for-developers).

## Setting Up

1. Assuming you have `mamba` installed, activate conda-forge:

   ```bash
   mamba config --add channels conda-forge
   mamba config --set channel_priority strict
   ```

2. [Clone](https://github.com/morphonets/pysnt.git) or [download](https://github.com/morphonets/pysnt/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) pysnt

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/hosting/directory
   git clone https://github.com/morphonets/pysnt.git
   ```

3. Create a new `pysnt` environment using the provided `environment.yml` file. This will install all the needed dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ./pysnt  # cd to pysnt root directory
   mamba env create -f environment.yml
   ```

   **Environment Options**: Other environment files are also provided for more granular installations:

   | File                | Scope/Comments                                        |
   |---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
   | environment.yml     | Full install with interactive GUI features  (default) |
   | environment-min.yml | Minimal CLI install with core dependencies only       |
   | environment-dev.yml | Full install plus dev tools for contributing to PySNT |

4. Install pysnt in editable/development mode

   ```bash
   mamba activate pysnt  # activate the newly created environment
   pip install -e .
   ```

5. Test that PySNT has been successfully installed, by displaying its version:

   ```bash
   mamba activate pysnt
   python -c "import pysnt; print(f'Using PySNT version: {pysnt.version()}')"
   ```

   Which should print something like:
   ```bash
   Using PySNT version: 0.0.1
   ```

6. **Optional**: Make the new `pysnt` environment available in Jupyter notebooks:

   ```bash
   mamba activate pysnt
   mamba install ipykernel
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=pysnt
   ```

   Now, when you start jupyter (or Jupyter lab), it will show `pysnt` in the list of registered kernels. Selecting it makes all the packages installed in the `pysnt` environment available.


### Attaching to SNT

PySNT requires a connection to a local SNT installation. There are two options:

1. **Use an existing Fiji installation** (recommended): Point PySNT to a Fiji install that's subscribed to the [NeuroAnatomy update site](https://imagej.net/SNT#install)

2. **Automatic download**: PySNT will automatically download the SNT binary in the background the first time you import an SNT class. This initial download may take several minutes, but subsequent runs will start instantly.


```{important}
Currently the automatic option does not retrieve the latest version of SNT. Until SNTv5 is officially released, it is best to point pyimagej to a SNT pre-release bundle:

1. Download a pre-release bundle from the [SNT Release Page](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT/releases).
   Unzip it to a local directory, e.g., `~/Downloads/`

2. Provide the installer with the path to the unzipped directory
```

### Interactive Setup

When you initialize pysnt using default options:

```python
import pysnt
pysnt.initialize()
```

The program will look for a Fiji install in common locations. If Fiji is not found, an interactive installer kicks in:

```terminaloutput
❌ Fiji installation not found!

PySNT requires Fiji to function. Here's how to fix this:

🔧 Quick Solutions:
  1. Run the interactive setup:
     python -m pysnt.setup_utils

  2. Auto-detect Fiji installation:
     python -m pysnt.setup_utils --auto-detect

📋 Alternative Methods:
  • Set environment variable: export FIJI_PATH='/path/to/Fiji.app'
  • Pass path directly: pysnt.initialize(fiji_path='/path/to/Fiji.app')
  • Use pysnt.set_fiji_path('/path/to/Fiji.app')

🔍 We checked these common locations:
  ✗ /Applications/Fiji.app
  ✗ ~/Downloads/Fiji.app
  ... and 3 more locations

💡 Need help? Check configuration status:
   python -m pysnt.setup_utils --status
```

## Verify Installation

To check version and system info:

```python
import pysnt
pysnt.initialize()  # Initialize first

print(f"PySNT version: {pysnt.version()}")
print("System info:")
pysnt.info()
```

This will output detailed system information:

```terminaloutput
PySNT version: 0.0.1
System info:
PySNT Version Information
===================================
PySNT version: 0.0.1
Author: SNT contributors

Python Environment:

  📍 Java executable: /Users/user/mamba/envs/pysnt-dev/lib/jvm/bin/java
  🏠 JAVA_HOME: /Users/user/mamba/envs/pysnt-dev/lib/jvm

🔬 SNT/Fiji Environment:
  ✅ PySNT initialized: Yes
  ℹ️ ImageJ version: 2.17.0/1.54p
  ℹ️ SNT version: 4.9.9-SNAPSHOT-04cbcaef56cfd037a0bd9a2d9a73050b86049d3b

### Test SNT Functionality

Now you can test that SNT access is fully functional:

```python
import pysnt
from pysnt import SNTService, Tree
pysnt.initialize()
snt_service = SNTService()  # Start SNT's SciJava service
print("✓ SNTService created successfully")

# Retrieve and display a demo neuron
tree = snt_service.demoTree('fractal')  # retrieve a toy neuron
print(f"✓ Demo tree loaded: {type(tree)}")

tree.show() # Display the reconstruction
```

Because SNT is running headless, the reconstruction is displayed as ascii art in the console.
We can also display it in a matplotlib figure:

```python
pysnt.display(tree)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Java Issues

PySNT includes Java management capabilities:

```python
# Check Java installation status
from pysnt.java_utils import print_java_status
print_java_status()
```

This will show detailed Java information:

```terminaloutput
☕ Java Installation Status
==============================
✅ Java available: openjdk version "21.0.8" 2025-07-15 LTS
📍 Executable: /Users/user/mamba/envs/pysnt-dev/lib/jvm/bin/java
🏠 JAVA_HOME: /Users/user/mamba/envs/pysnt-dev/lib/jvm
🏢 Vendor: OpenJDK
✅ Version check: 21 >= 21 (recommended)
```

### Manual Java Setup

```python
# Ensure Java 21 or newer is available
from pysnt.java_utils import ensure_java_available
ensure_java_available(required_version=21)
```

```python
# Interactive Java setup wizard (experimental)
from pysnt.java_utils import setup_java_environment
setup_java_environment()
```

### Common Issues

1. **"Fiji not found" error**: Set `FIJI_PATH` environment variable, or use the interactive setup:
   ```python
   import pysnt
   pysnt.initialize(interactive =True)  # 8GB heap
   ```
2. **Java version issues**: Ensure Java 21+ is installed and accessible
3. **Memory issues**: Use memory configuration:
   ```python
   import pysnt
   pysnt.initialize(max_heap="8g")  # 8GB heap
   ```
4. **Import errors**: Make sure you've activated the correct conda environment

### Getting Help

```python
# Show version and system information
pysnt.show_version()
pysnt.info()

# Check configuration
pysnt.show_config_status()

# List available classes to verify SNT is working
pysnt.list_classes()
```
